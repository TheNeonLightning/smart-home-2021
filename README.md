# Smart Home

The main part of the project lies in the folder [src/main/java/ru/sbt/mipt/oop](https://github.com/TheNeonLightning/smart-home-2021/tree/master/src/main/java/ru/sbt/mipt/oop) 

The project implements a "smart home". The house has sensors which are connected to the central server. Sensors send 
events when lights are turned on/off or doors are opened/closed.
